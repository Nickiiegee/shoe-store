### Overview
This project is an online shoe store that has been created to finish my _Capstone Project_ with _**HyperionDev**_. 

### Reason of Store
I have created this online store, _Season Shoes_, to show what I have learned thus far and what I am capable of. It was supposed to show that I can use the necessary functions to have a fully responsive website and to add calculations to add the total of the items selected together as well as a shipping fee.

### Install Project
My project is stored on GitHub as a remote repository. If you are in _Season Shoes'_ repository and you'd wish to contribute to this website, please follow the following steps:
  * navigate to the main page of the repository.
  * under the repository name, click on the "Clone or download" button

  * In the Clone with HTTPs section, click  to copy the clone URL for the repository.

  * Open the Git Bash Terminal
  * Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  * Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2.
  * Press **Enter**. Your local clone will be created.
  
 OR
 to clone it to your Desktop:
  1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
  1. Under your repository name, click  to clone your repository in Desktop. Follow the prompts in GitHub Desktop to complete the clone. For more information, see "Cloning a          repository from GitHub to GitHub Desktop."
  
### Usage
Each page has got its own HTML, CSS and JavaScript file in the respective folders. I used _Visual Studio Code_ to create my application code. All links and calculations are working 100%.

### Credits
This project was 99% done by myself, _Monique Geldenhuys_, with the help of my mentor, _Imraan Meyer_ and a friend in the tech industry, _Ruan Potgieter_. Without their help with the little technicalities, I think I would have had some issues with some functions not working. I have learned an awful lot from these two!
